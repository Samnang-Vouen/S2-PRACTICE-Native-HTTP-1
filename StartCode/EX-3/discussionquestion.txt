1. Why do we listen for data and end events when handling POST? 
=> Because POST data comes in chunks. And we use end to collect chunks and then process the whole body when the steam end.

2. What would happen if we didnâ€™t buffer the body correctly? 
=> We might:
    - Get incomplete or corrupted data 
    - Try to parse the body before it's fully received, leading to errors.
    - Miss form fienld or get partail input.

3. What is the format of form submissions when using the default browser form POST? 
=> The format of form submissions format is:
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded

4. Why do we use fs.appendFile instead of fs.writeFile? 
=> We use fs.appendFile instead of fs.writeFile because fs.appendFile adds data to the end
of the file whitout erasing existing content. But fs.writeFile overwirtes the file every time.

5. How could this be improved or made more secure?
=> We can improved or made more secure by:
    - Use HTTPS: encrypt data in transit to protect user info.
    - Store data in datavase
    - Use a framework: for automatically handling body parsing, routing and security headers.
    - Validation: Check if the input is empty, contain invalid characters, or is too long.
